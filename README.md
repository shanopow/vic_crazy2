# vic_crazy2
A redesign ofthe original vic_crazy prototype.
This version is essentially a replacement for the normal vic_crazy with some major restructuring.
Major changes include:

Completely changing basic data types (vectors instead of arrays)
Re-ordering of functinos and their respective pages, resulting in a way easier to understand each file.
Better use of classes in general, eg holders in classes, no nasty hard-codings, etc
